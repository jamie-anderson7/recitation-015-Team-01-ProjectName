Our project is a social workout app that gives users daily workouts and allows them to share their workout routines with friends. The name of our app is Social Sweat and we are creating it to make working out fun and accessible to everyone. Social Sweat includes a variety of different features. When the user registers, they will be asked to list their fitness level as Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced, based on different parameters that will be listed. This determines which exercise the user can start with. When the user logs in to their account, they will see a to-do list with workouts for that day, which will come from an external API. The user will have the option to schedule the workouts on their calendar and share their calendar with friends. They can also see which workouts their friends have scheduled on the calendar.
	Unlike other workout apps, our app will be structured more like a game, with awards that the users can earn and a public leaderboard. As users progress through workouts and do more difficult challenges, they will unlock rewards, such as profile icons, different kinds of workouts, and workout gear. This will incentivize users to improve their fitness in a healthy way, as workouts will be organized in a way that allows for healthy progression.
