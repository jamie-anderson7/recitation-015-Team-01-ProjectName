Application Name: Social Sweat


Application Description: Exercise App
Our project is a social workout app that gives users daily workouts and allows them to share their workout routines with friends. The name of our app is Social Sweat and we are creating it to make working out fun and accessible to beginners. Social Sweat includes a variety of different features. When the user registers, they will be assigned an initial amount of points to unlock beginner exercises. When the user logs in to their account, they will see a to-do list with workouts for that day, which will come from an external API. The user will have the option to schedule the workouts on their calendar and share their calendar with friends. They can also see which workouts their friends have scheduled on the calendar.
        Unlike other workout apps, our app will be structured more like a game, with awards that the users can earn and a public leaderboard. As users progress through workouts and do more difficult challenges, they will unlock rewards, such as profile icons, different kinds of workouts, and workout gear. This will incentivize users to improve their fitness in a healthy way, as workouts will be organized in a way that allows for healthy progression. 


Vision Statement: For young people who are beginners to working out, who want a fun and accessible way to get into fitness. The Social Sweat app is a social workout app that gives users an easy way to improve their fitness while earning fun rewards and connecting with others. Unlike Strava, or other social workout apps, our product gives users specific workouts making it accessible for beginners, and provides encouragement via our reward system.
